Since completing my degree in Biochemistry at the Universidad Austral de Chile, I have been interested in transferring knowledge from the field of Molecular Biology to the Applied Sciences. Pursuing a Master of Science (Bioinformatics) at the University of Melbourne opened the doors to the world of genomic data. I undertook this program with the support of the Becas Chile scholarship from ANID.

During the second year of the pandemic, I had the opportunity to contribute to SARS-CoV-2 research at the University of Magallanes. At the Center for Applied Biological Research (CIBA), I focused on viruses and bacteria relevant to the aquaculture industry.

I am currently part of Neocrop Technologies, where I have the opportunity to contribute to food security â€” a crucial element in ensuring sustainable access to nutritious food, especially in the face of population growth and climate challenges. Crop genetic improvement plays a key role in increasing agricultural productivity and resilience to adverse conditions. In this context, bioinformatics emerges as a powerful tool, enabling the analysis of large-scale genomic and transcriptomic data to identify genes associated with desirable traits, such as drought tolerance or disease resistance, thus accelerating the development of more adapted and productive crop varieties.
